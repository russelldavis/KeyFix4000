I love the MS Natural Keyboard 4000, but it has a couple issues:

1. It is conspicuously missing a Windows key on the right side.
2. There is no way to remap the back and forward buttons to act as mouse buttons.

KeyFix4000 fixes both of these.

The mouse button mapping is pretty straight-forward - it just translates a click on the back/forward button to a click on the left/right mouse button.

The Windows key issue is a little tricky - how do you fix a key that doesn't exist? Well, the Apps key is pretty much where the Windows key should be, and I realized I could overload it. Now, when pressed by itself, it functions as the Apps key, and when pressed in combination with another key, it works as the Windows key. This dual usage works surprisingly well.

KeyFix4000 was originally published [on my blog](http://russelldavis.blogspot.com/2006/11/keyfix4000-improve-your-ms-natural.html).
